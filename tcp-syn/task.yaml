    TCP segments contain flags. These are defined in `Section 3.1 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1>`_ of `RFC793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793>`_.

    The segment below was sent by a client to create a TCP connection towards a web server. Ingicated the values of the SYN, URG, PSH, ACK, FIN and RST flags inside this segment (1 means set and 0 means reset)?

        feedback:
            tcp.flags.ack: The ACK flag is only set when the segment contains a valid
                acknowledgement number. This is not the case in the initial segment
                sent by a client.
            tcp.flags.fin: The RST flag is used to gracefully terminate a connection,
                not to create one.
            tcp.flags.psh: The PSH flag is only associated with data. It is never
                set in the first segment sent to create a TCP connection.
            tcp.flags.rst: The RST flag is used to abruptly terminate a connection,
                not to create one.
            tcp.flags.syn: The SYN flag is set in the first segment sent to initiate
                a TCP connection as described in `Section 3.7 of RFC 793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.4>`_.
            tcp.flags.urg: The URG flag is only set in Urgent data as described in
                `Section 3.7 of RFC 793 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.4>`_.
                It is never set in the first segment sent to create a TCP connection.
